Write a script named mas_o_menos.py.

The goal of this exercice is to create a mini game where you need to guess a number. For the purpose of the exercice, the result to guess will be specified on the standard entry (though obviously that makes the guessing part a lot easier...!).

The player has 10 tries to guess the number.

If the player guesses right, you will display Congrats ! and quit.

If the player guesses a number smaller than the result :

    if the difference is above 50 you will display It's way more.
    if the difference is 50 or less you will display It's more.

If the player guesses a number bigger than the result :

    if the difference is above 50 you will display It's way less.
    if the difference is 50 or less you will display It's less.

If the player doesn't find the result after 10 tries, you will display You lose :(.

Take a look at the example, you need to reproduce the exact same output to make the Sentinel happy!
