You have done your shopping and it's time to checkout. You want to give as few banknotes and coins as possible to pay your bill.

Payment is made in Japanese yen, and you can use any official banknotes and coins.

You have to look at the example below to figure out the edge cases (what happens when the bill is 0? When it's negative?)

Your program will be called money.py.

$ python3 money.py 
What's the bill ? 3451
1 2000 banknote
1 1000 banknote
4 100 coin
1 50 coin
1 1 coin
$ python3 money.py 
What's the bill ? 0
Oh, it was free !
$ python3 money.py 
What's the bill ? -98
Well, it's you who owes me money then.
