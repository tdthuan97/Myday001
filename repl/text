Write a script named repl.py.

In this exercice, you will have to write a small repl - that is, a read-eval-print-loop. You read the standard entry, do something based on what you just read, print the output if needed, and loop back at the beginning to wait for another entry.

Here are the different actions possible. You have to follow the same order to evaluate which action should be taken:

    if the string you read is 'quit', you quit
    if the length of string you read is 6, display My length is 6
    if the first letter of the string is a, e, i, o or u, display 4 times the 2nde, 3rd and 4th letter of the string (see the example)
    if the string is one of "ls", "cat", "rev" or "pwd", display I know the command XXX !! (replace XXX by the name of the command)
    if the string starts with a 0 and doesn't end with a 9, display all the numbers present in the string
    else do nothing


$>python3 repl.py
repl> hello!
My length is 6
repl> abcdefg
bcd
bcd

repl> cat
I know the command cat !!
